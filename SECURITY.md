**1. Reporting Vulnerabilities:**

We appreciate your help in keeping this project secure. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by following these steps:

**1.1 Public Reporting:**

- If the vulnerability can be disclosed publicly without compromising security, you can create a public issue report on the project's GitHub repository.

**1.2 Private Reporting:**

- **We have enabled private vulnerability reporting on GitHub.** For vulnerabilities that should be kept confidential until a fix is released, please follow the steps outlined in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)

- **Detailed Description:** Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it and potential impact.
- **Confidentiality:** Keep the vulnerability confidential until a fix is released to prevent exploitation.

We will acknowledge your report and work on a fix with the following goals:

- **Fix Release:** We will release a fix for the vulnerability in a timely manner.

**2. Secure Coding Practices:**

The script development follows best practices for secure coding to minimize vulnerabilities. These practices include:

- **Input Validation:** User input is sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- **Dependency Management:** Dependencies are kept up-to-date to address known vulnerabilities in external libraries.
- **Secret Handling:** Sensitive information (if any) is not stored in plain text.

**3. Supported Versions:**

We will only provide security fixes for the most recent versions of the bot. Users are encouraged to stay up-to-date with the latest releases to benefit from the latest security improvements.

**4. Disclaimer:**

While we strive to maintain the security of this script through development practices, it's provided as-is and we cannot guarantee that it is completely free of vulnerabilities. Users are encouraged to exercise caution when using any automated tools that interact with websites.
